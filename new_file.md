hi Sarah
I'm writing important stuff -- good code stuff.
Hi Timmy
#Say I am writing a lot more code. Right now, pretty much what I'll do is this -
**What's up everybody** _Time to use Markdown in Atom_
#Nice, um hello
So what happens if I write something on here, save it, but then don't "git add" it, can It still be committed and pushed?
Okay, so it will have no changes to commit because it wasn't added to be staged for commit.
